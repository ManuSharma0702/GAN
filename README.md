Project Title: Generating Synthetic Images of Digits using GAN from MNIST Dataset

Introduction:
This project aims to generate synthetic images of handwritten digits using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) trained on the MNIST dataset. GANs are a class of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the capability of GANs to generate realistic synthetic images resembling handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

Dataset:
The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images of handwritten digits, along with their corresponding labels. It contains a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. This dataset is widely used for training and testing machine learning models.

Technologies Used:

Python: Programming language used for coding the project.
TensorFlow/Keras: Deep learning framework used for implementing the GAN architecture.
NumPy: Library used for numerical computations.
Matplotlib: Library used for data visualization.
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive computing environment used for running Python code.
Project Structure:

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.
gan_mnist.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for training and testing the GAN model.
generated_images/: Directory containing the synthetic images generated by the GAN model.
models/: Directory containing saved models trained during the project.
results/: Directory containing any additional results or analysis.
Instructions for Running the Code:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure that you have Python and necessary libraries installed (TensorFlow, NumPy, Matplotlib).
Open gan_mnist.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook.
Follow the instructions within the notebook to train the GAN model and generate synthetic images.
Results:
After training the GAN model, synthetic images resembling handwritten digits will be generated. Additionally, evaluation metrics and visualizations will be provided within the Jupyter Notebook.
